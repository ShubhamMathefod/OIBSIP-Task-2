        <h2 id="title_hedy"><center>The Life of M.S Dhoni</center></h2>

        <p>  M.S Dhoni was born in 7th July 1981 in Ranchi Jharkhand.

        <p>Mahendra Singh Dhoni captained the Indian National Team in the limited-overs format from 2007 to 2016 and in the Test format from 2008 to 2014. He led India to win the 2007 ICC World Twenty20, 2010 & 2016 Asia Cup, 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup and 2013 ICC Champions Trophy. Dhoni is also the current captain of IPLâ€™s franchise Chennai Super Kings. </p>

        <p>

            Although Dhoni did not play that much cricket initially, he impressed everyone with his wicket-keeping skills and became a regular wicket-keeper of the Commando Cricket Club from 1995-1998. In 1998, Deval Sahay selected Dhoni to play for the Central Coal Fields Limited (CCL) team. 

        <p>

            The Indian team had traveled to the Caribbean to take part in the 2007 ODI World Cup. Led by Rahul Dravid, it was a star-studded unit with the likes of Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly, Virender Sehwag, Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh. But opposite to the expectations, India crashed out of the tournament in the first round itself after suffering humiliating defeats at the hands of Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.</p>

 

        <p>

            The team including MS Dhoni received huge criticism and rage from the fans. Later that year, the inaugural World Cup of T20 cricket was to be held in South Africa. All the big guns had pulled out of the squad and as a result, MS Dhoni became the captain of the side which had young and fresh talents. </p>

        <p>

            India went on to lift the trophy and that was the official inception of the Dhoni era in Indian cricket, under his leadership. He became the ODI captain, after the victorious triumph. Leadership came naturally to him and once he got that, he flourished to his best. After Anil Kumble retired from international cricket, Dhoni became the skipper of all 3 formats for India.</p>

        <p>

            During his captaincy, the Men in Blue achieved several remarkable victories that included the Commonwealth Bank tri-series in Australia. Team India went on to become No.1 in ICC Test Rankings in his reign.</p>

        <p>

            He was awarded Padma Bhushan in 2018 and Padma Shri in 2009, and Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award in 2007-08. Under his captainship, India won the 2011 World Cup. MS Dhoni was the first player to win the ODI Player of the year award twice once in 2008 and 2009.Indian Army conferred with the honorary rank of Lieutenant Colonel in 2011. He is the second Indian cricketer to receive the honor after Kapil Dev.MS Dhoni was also awarded the ICC ODI Player of the year in 2008 and 2009. He also received the ICC World ODI XI. In 2011, he was conferred with Castro! Indian Cricketer of the year.In 2006, he was awarded MTV Youth Icon of the year. In 2013, he received LG People's Choice Award.
